*Codename **Project Minkowski*** is a multiplayer space battler with mathematically correct special (and a little bit general) relativity. No longer are you an omniscient oracle, your information, and perception, of your current situation will depend on a finite speed of light that's the same no matter how you look at it.

***Project Minkowski*** is in a very early stage, and needs a lot of code cleanup (especially from someone who understands relativity better than me).

***Project Minkowski*** is licensed under the **AGPL-V3**.
