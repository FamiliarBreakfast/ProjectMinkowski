*Codename **Project Minkowski*** is a multiplayer space battler with mathematically correct special (and a little bit general) relativity. No longer are you an omniscient oracle, your information, and perception, of your current situation will depend on a finite speed of light that's the same no matter how you look at it.

***Project Minkowski*** is in a very early stage, and needs a lot of code cleanup (especially from someone who understands relativity better than me).

***Project Minkowski*** is licensed under the **AGPL-V3**, except where otherwise noted.

**TODO:**
- Asteroids or some kind of object fields (in progress)
- doppler effect (hiatus)
- More weapons (in progress)
- better movement (in progress)
- - powerups/boosts
- - possible ftl boost powerup for short periods of time
- Powerups?
- Animations/particles
- refactor entity/collision system for better performance
- custom input system (in progress)
- predictive aim reticle
- FTL?? There is engine support (in the sense it doesnt immedietly crash)
- - could cause paradoxes?
- - - might not be a problem
- weird ftl stuff???
- retrocausal stuff??????????
- - is this even possible?
- - - backwards weapon fire?
- - - reactive defense?
- the camera should rotate instead of the ship
- remove monogame extended
- (long term) teams and chat (with signal delay)
- (long term) Online networking
- (long term) Partial general relativity
