Codename Project Minkowski is a multiplayer space battler with mathematically correct special relativity. No longer are you an omnescient oracle, your information, and perception, of your current situation will depend on a finite speed of light that's the same no matter how you look at it.

Project Minkowski is in a very early stage, and needs a lot of code cleanup (especially from someone who understands relativity better than me).

Project Minkowski is licensed under the AGPL-V3.
